# Class-Scheduler-PHP
This is a project I made in PHP.  I wanted to use MVC to make a more complex app.  This program is a crud app to edit a class schedule, something like a school administrator would use.

It shows my knowledge of PHP, SQL, and MVC.  Since I know OOP I plan on rewriting it some point to use OOP principles and to have better input and output sanitization.
